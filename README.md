# Predicting-Human-Diseases-from-Symptoms-Attention-Graph-Embeddings-and-Deep-Learning


**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates a novel approach for **predicting human diseases from patient-reported symptoms** using a combination of **attention-weighted symptom embeddings**, **severity scaling**, **symptom co-occurrence graph embeddings**, and **structured features**. A **deep neural network** is used to integrate these heterogeneous features and predict diseases, while explainability techniques provide clinical insights.

## Motivation

Accurate early disease prediction is crucial for healthcare. This project aims to:

* Understand relationships between symptoms and diseases
* Leverage **severity information** for symptom importance
* Provide interpretable predictions for clinical insights

---

## Dataset

* **Source:** Pre-generated symptom-based human disease dataset
* **Columns:** `Symptom_1` ‚Ä¶ `Symptom_17`, `severity`, `Disease`
* **Preprocessing:** Missing symptoms filled with 'none', symptom lists created per patient

---

## Pipeline

1. **Symptom Embedding:** Use **GloVe 50d embeddings** to convert symptom text to vectors.
2. **Attention √ó Severity:** Compute patient-specific attention scores and scale by severity.
3. **Symptom Co-occurrence Graph:** Build co-occurrence matrix and reduce dimensionality with **TruncatedSVD**.
4. **Structured Features:** Encode symptom presence with **one-hot vectors**.
5. **Feature Combination:** Concatenate **attention embeddings**, **graph embeddings**, and **structured features**.
6. **Deep Neural Network:** Fully connected network predicts diseases using combined features.
7. **Explainability:**

   * Attention heatmaps for patients
   * SHAP analysis
   * Top-k predictive symptoms per disease

* Confusion Matrix

Confusion matrix to evaluate how well a classification model performs by detailing its true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions, offering a more comprehensive understanding than simple accuracy.

## Future Work

* Integrate **temporal symptom progression** for longitudinal predictions.
* Explore **multi-branch neural networks** for structured vs. embedding inputs.
* Apply pipeline to larger, real-world datasets for clinical validation.
